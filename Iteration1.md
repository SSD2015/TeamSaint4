Iteration Objective(s)

List the objectives you want to accomplish and major tasks needed to meet the objectives. During iteration planning and your team meetings you will find additional tasks and more detailed tasks. Add the major tasks here. All tasks should be created as "Issues" in the online issue tracking system. Don't need to write detailed tasks here.

You can write objectives as a list instead of table.
